# Flood risk acceptance tests

You may need an environmental permit if you want to work in, over, under or near a main river or flood or sea defence. Some flood risk activities are exempt from needing a permit and you can carry out the work if you [register an exemption](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/register-your-flood-risk-exemption-environmental-permits).

[Register a flood risk activity exemption](https://register-flood-risk-exemption.service.gov.uk/) is the digital service which allows users to register an exemption.

This project contains the acceptance tests for the service. It is built around [Quke](https://github.com/EnvironmentAgency/quke), a Ruby gem that simplifies the process of writing and running Cucumber acceptance tests.
